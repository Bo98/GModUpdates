# RIP [@GModUpdates](https://twitter.com/GModUpdates) August 2014-November 2015
Unfortunately due to changes by Facepunch, this bot no longer functions as it should since Garry's Mod changes are no longer tweeted through [@FacepunchBot](https://twitter.com/FacepunchBot).

I still use the account manually when changes are posted on the [Facepunch forums](https://facepunch.com) but sadly this is now dependent on someone doing that rather than every change being automatically tweeted.

You'll have to ask Garry on why he decided to remove it.

This bot is still running for the time being in the event of a surprise return but the text filter may need to be tweaked after the layout of [@FacepunchBot](https://twitter.com/FacepunchBot) tweets changed.
